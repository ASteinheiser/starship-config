## Starship config

This is my personal starship config. Its basically a custom color themed version of powerline.

_I also included my fish config, which automatically runs starship and tries to use_ `nvm` _to switch node versions when changing directories_

__NOTE__: You'll need to [install bass](https://github.com/edc/bass?tab=readme-ov-file#manually) for the fish config to work properly. It's simply copying two files, they just maintain a more up-to-date version
